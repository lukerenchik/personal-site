# Intro

My journey to become an engineer has been an interesting one, 								
If you asked me what I was going to be at 11 years old, I would have told you I don't know but I want to do something great.

<br>
If you asked me what I was going to be at 15 years old, I would have told you I was going to be a professional Magic the Gathering player. Why? Well, it was the first thing I got good at, I won some money, and the internal and external perception of my skills were aligned.

<br>

If you asked me what I was going to be at 19 years old, I would have told you I was going to be a professional League of Legends player. Why? It was my first brush with being the best at something I had pursued. I frequently competed with the best players in North America, and oftentimes held my own. During this time I started a ragtag team from my dorm room and made huge waves on campus.

<br>

Today, my goal is to become a great engineer, to improve my skills each day, to solve interesting and challenging problems, and to contribute to humanity's collective push towards a better and brighter future.

# Selected Writings

<br>
The last hour has been an eternity, <br>
If there is a secret to everlasting consciousness <br>
Its filing documents. <br>
It never ends. <br>

July 2021 <br>
<br>
I lost two to the same disease <br>
Drugs, <br>
Addiction, <br>
Self Deprecating Mania. <br>
They dissolve their connections to the world, <br>
Until all that is left, <br>
Is themselves. <br>
<br>
Strength in self, <br>
In pursuing that brighter tomorrow, <br>
Is easy to lose hold of, <br>
But we must take every step we can, <br>
Because even if we can’t control the future, <br>
We sure can move the needle. <br>

You may only visit a place for the first time once,<br>
Use it wisely and cherish that moment.<br>

<br>
Do not work until you can win, <br>
Work until it is impossible to lose. <br>
